This repository serves as a study backlog for my learning journey in C++23, based on the book “C++23 para Windows” by Prof. Augusto Manzano.

For the exercises, I also use another book by the same author, “Algoritmos: Lógica para o Desenvolvimento de Programação de Computadores”, which provides the logical and algorithmic foundation for the implementations.

Below are the covers of each book.
